# GDS-
I've made my best attempts at a basic model of the gov.uk website by using html
ive added interactive buttons which contrast compared to the background so its easier to identifiable by users with reduced eye sight 
ive added undo and redo buttons at right corner so information would not be accidently deleted 
upon entry of the website you have to login first which will log you into all  primary government websites and the search bar will search across all govt webpages
ive added individual buttons which redirect to that certian govt website 
updated the login systems with php and my sql compared to html
